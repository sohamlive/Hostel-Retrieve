# Hostel-Retrieve
I made these scripts to download the images of all the hostelers who would be residing in the hostels of Thapar University. 

Thapar University, Patiala implements a new registration system every year to gather data of students who would be staying the hostels. People
had to upload their photos. I want to make it clear that these scripts were made only for **informative** purposes of data scraping.

Uses Python along with BeautifulSoup and PrettyTable.

*These scripts doesn't work anymore. The site has been taken down and all data removed as soon as the session 2017-2018 began.*
